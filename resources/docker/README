1. Update values in configuration/config.txt to your preferences (hostname should be entered without any protocol and slashes, e.g. symbiote-open.man.poznan.pl, other parameters can be any strings; certificate password is a NEW password for a p12 certificate that will be generated from .pem files)
2. Put your server certificate (cert.pem, privkey.pem, chain.pem and fullchain.pem) in configuration/cert directory; the easiest way to get an SSL certificate is by using 'Let's encrypt' service
3. Run ./buildAll.sh to build all required images
4. If you're not running docker swarm yet, execute 'docker swarm init'
5. Run symbioteCoreStart.sh to run all services
6. Run symbioteCoreStop.sh to stop all services
7. To get logs of each service, connect to container running symbiote-core (docker exec -it <container_name> bash). Log of each component can be accessed in each component's home directory as a screen.log file or by reattaching to a running screen session (screen -r <component_name>).
